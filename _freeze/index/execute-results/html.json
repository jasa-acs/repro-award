Examples of outstanding reproducibility efforts include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Writing reproducible code and analyses\n- Building research objects (e.g. workflows, software, benchmarks, computational environments, etc) to help others improve reproducibility of their own code and analyses\n- Generating open datasets/software of relevance to the scientific community\n- Evaluating the reproducibility of results in the scientific literature\n- Developing improved reproducibility processes and guidelines\n\n# Process and Criteria\n\n1. The award amounts to US $500.\n2. Criteria for eligibility of the award include \n\n    - All papers that are accepted into *JASA* by December 31 are eligible for the award in the following year at JSM. \n    - Each AER can nominate at most three papers from the calendar year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31) to be discussed as potential candidates for the award.\n    \n3. Process for selection of the award: \n\n    - In spring before JSM, the AERs meet to discuss all nominated papers from the previous year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31). \n    - Using the pool of nominated papers, the AERs will use a ranked-choice voting (RCV) system where each AER ranks nominated papers. \n        - If a nominated paper wins the majority of first-preference votes, the paper will be awarded. \n        - If no nominated paper wins a majority of first-preference votes, the nominated paper with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. \n        - First preference votes for the failed nominated paper are eliminated, lifting the second preference choices. \n        - A new tally is conducted to determine whether any nominated paper has won the majority of the adjusted votes. \n        - The process is repeated until a nominated paper wins an outright majority. \n        - Nominated papers with the second and third largest preferences will be awarded in a similar way.\n \n4. Post-selection award process: \n\n    - AERs will notify the winners by May before JSM.\n    - The award would be presented at JSM in July or August. \n    - The check will be mailed to the first author of the winning publications.\n    - Papers from current AERs are not eligible to receive the award. \n\n\n",
