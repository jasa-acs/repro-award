Examples of outstanding reproducibility efforts include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Writing reproducible code and analyses\n- Building research objects (e.g. workflows, software, benchmarks, computational environments, etc) to help others improve reproducibility of their own code and analyses\n- Generating open datasets/software of relevance to the scientific community\n- Evaluating the reproducibility of results in the scientific literature\n- Developing improved reproducibility processes and guidelines\n\n# Process and Criteria\n\n1. The award amounts to US $500.\n2. Criteria for nomination include \n\n    - All papers that are accepted into *JASA* by December 15 are eligible for the award in the following year at JSM. \n    - In spring before JSM, the AERs will select the winners from papers accepted into JASA the previous year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31). \n    - AERs will notify the winners by May.\n    - The award would be presented at JSM in July or August. \n    - The check will be mailed to the first author of the winning publications. \n    - Papers from current AERs are not eligible to receive the award. \n\n\n",
