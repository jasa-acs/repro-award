    "text": "Overview\nThe Editor-Selected JASA Reproducibility Award, established in 2022 by the JASA Associate Editors of Reproducibility (AERs), aims to recognize outstanding papers from JASA Applications and Case Studies (ACS) or JASA Theory and Methods (TM) in terms of their computational reproducibility. This award will evaluate the code, data, and the workflow to reproduce the work presented in the paper as part of all invited revisions to Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA).\nUp to three papers are selected every year by the AERs and an award is presented to the authors during the annual Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) the following year at Computing and Graphics Joint Section Meeting.\nEach award comes with a $500 honorarium.\n\n\nGoals\nThis award aims to encourage computational reproducibility efforts in the statistical field and to reward outstanding papers that, by implementing rigorous reproducibility processes, increase access to important data, analytic tools, and workflows for the scientific community. Examples of outstanding reproducibility efforts include, but are not limited to:\n\nWriting reproducible code and analyses\nBuilding research objects (e.g. workflows, software, benchmarks, computational environments, etc) to help others improve reproducibility of their own code and analyses\nGenerating open datasets/software of relevance to the scientific community\nEvaluating the reproducibility of results in the scientific literature\nDeveloping improved reproducibility processes and guidelines\n\n\n\nProcess and Criteria\n\nThe award amounts to US $500.\nCriteria for eligibility of the award include\n\nAll papers that are accepted into JASA by December 31 are eligible for the award in the following year at JSM.\nEach AER can nominate at most three papers from the calendar year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31) to be discussed as potential candidates for the award.\n\nProcess for selection of the award:\n\nIn spring before JSM, the AERs meet to discuss all nominated papers from the previous year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31).\nUsing the pool of nominated papers, the AERs will use a ranked-choice voting (RCV) system where each AER ranks nominated papers.\n\nIf a nominated paper wins the majority of first-preference votes, the paper will be awarded.\nIf no nominated paper wins a majority of first-preference votes, the nominated paper with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated.\nFirst preference votes for the failed nominated paper are eliminated, lifting the second preference choices.\nA new tally is conducted to determine whether any nominated paper has won the majority of the adjusted votes.\nThe process is repeated until a nominated paper wins an outright majority.\nNominated papers with the second and third largest preferences will be awarded in a similar way.\n\n\nPost-selection award process:\n\nAERs will notify the winners by May before JSM.\nThe award would be presented at JSM in July or August.\nThe check will be mailed to the first author of the winning publications.\nPapers from current AERs are not eligible to receive the award."

    "text": "In July 2016, the JASA Reproducibility Initiative was introduced, which aimed to increase the reproducibility of manuscripts published in JASA Applications and Case Studies (ACS). For example, in the first half of 2016, less than 20 percent of papers published in JASA ACS provided any supporting code or data that would enable reproduction of their results.\nIn 2021, the initiative celebrated its five-year anniversary and expanded the initiative to include JASA Theory and Methods manuscripts.\nAs of September 1, 2021, all original research manuscripts submitted to JASA undergoes a reproducibility review with authors required to provide their reproducibility materials when invited to revise their initial submission.\nCode for published papers are made available in GitHub repositories."
