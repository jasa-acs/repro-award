    "text": "In July 2016, the JASA Reproducibility Initiative was introduced, which aimed to increase the reproducibility of manuscripts published in JASA Applications and Case Studies (ACS). For example, in the first half of 2016, less than 20 percent of papers published in JASA ACS provided any supporting code or data that would enable reproduction of their results.\nIn 2021, the initiative celebrated its five-year anniversary and expanded the initiative to include JASA Theory and Methods manuscripts.\nAs of September 1, 2021, all original research manuscripts submitted to JASA undergoes a reproducibility review with authors required to provide their reproducibility materials when invited to revise their initial submission.\nCode for published papers are made available in GitHub repositories."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Editor-Selected JASA Reproducibility Award, established in 2022 by the JASA Associate Editors of Reproducibility (AERs), aims to recognize outstanding papers from JASA Applications and Case Studies (ACS) or JASA Theory and Methods (TM) in terms of their computational reproducibility. This award will evaluate the code, data, and the workflow to reproduce the work presented in the paper as part of all invited revisions to Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA).\nUp to three papers are selected every year by the AERs and an award is presented to the authors during the annual Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) the following year at the JASA session where editors invite individuals to present their work.\nEach award comes with a $500 honorarium.\n\n\nGoals\nThis award aims to encourage computational reproducibility efforts in the statistical field and to reward outstanding papers that, by implementing rigorous reproducibility processes, increase access to important data, analytic tools, and workflows for the scientific community. Examples of outstanding reproducibility efforts include, but are not limited to:\n\nWriting reproducible code and analyses\nBuilding research objects (e.g. workflows, software, benchmarks, computational environments, etc) to help others improve reproducibility of their own code and analyses\nGenerating open datasets/software of relevance to the scientific community\nEvaluating the reproducibility of results in the scientific literature\nDeveloping improved reproducibility processes and guidelines\n\n\n\nProcess and Criteria\n\nThe award amounts to US $500.\nCriteria for nomination include\n\nAll papers that are accepted into JASA by December 15 are eligible for the award in the following year at JSM.\nIn spring before JSM, the AERs will select the winners from papers accepted into JASA the previous year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31).\nAERs will notify the winners by May.\nThe award would be presented at JSM in July or August.\nThe check will be mailed to the first author of the winning publications.\nPapers from current AERs are not eligible to receive the award."
