# Overview

The Editor-Selected JASA Reproducibility Award, established in 2022 by the [JASA Associate Editors of Reproducibility (AERs)](about.qmd), aims to recognize outstanding papers from *JASA Applications and Case Studies* (ACS) or *JASA Theory and Methods* (TM) in terms of their computational reproducibility. 
This award will evaluate the code, data, and the workflow to reproduce the work presented in the paper as part of all invited revisions to [*Journal of the American Statistical Association*](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uasa20) (*JASA*). 

Up to three papers are selected every year by the AERs and an award is presented to the authors during the annual Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) the following year at the JASA session where editors invite individuals to present their work. 

Each award comes with a $500 honorarium. 

# Goals

This award aims to encourage computational reproducibility efforts in the statistical field and to reward outstanding papers that, by implementing rigorous reproducibility processes, increase access to important data, analytic tools, and workflows for the scientific community. Examples of outstanding reproducibility efforts include, but are not limited to:

- Writing reproducible code and analyses
- Building research objects (e.g. workflows, software, benchmarks, computational environments, etc) to help others improve reproducibility of their own code and analyses
- Generating open datasets/software of relevance to the scientific community
- Evaluating the reproducibility of results in the scientific literature
- Developing improved reproducibility processes and guidelines

# Process and Criteria

1. The award amounts to US $500.
2. Criteria for nomination include 

    - All papers that are accepted into *JASA* by December 15 are eligible for the award in the following year at JSM. 
    - In spring before JSM, the AERs will select the winners from papers accepted into JASA the previous year (e.g. Jan 1 - Dec 31). 
    - AERs will notify the winners by May.
    - The award would be presented at JSM in July or August. 
    - The check will be mailed to the first author of the winning publications. 
    - Papers from current AERs are not eligible to receive the award.
